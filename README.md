[https://blunt-barbershop.netlify.app/](https://blunt-barbershop.netlify.app/)
## Introduction
This is a simple landing page for Blunt Barbershop, showcasing its services and ambiance, with a call-to-action for appointment scheduling. It's designed to align with the brand's aesthetics.

## Purpose
I took on this project to get acquainted with the Bootstrap UI framework and learn responsive web design. Also, I wanted to understand how to effectively interpret and implement client requirements.

## Potential Improvements
If I had more time, I would consider the following:
- Replace Parcel bundler with Vite for more efficiency
- Optimize asset size for improved loading speed and performance
- Use PurgeCSS to minimize file sizes and enhance page loading speed
- Add blurred minimized images and use them during loading
- Implement proper internationalization
- Test and expand on accessibility features
- Revise HTML meta tags for improved SEO
- Redesign section backgrounds for smoother transitions
- Redesign the main logo SVG animations for better visual appeal

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap)
- JavaScript
